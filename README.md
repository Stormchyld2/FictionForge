NovelGenerator is an LLM-powered tool that expands brief concepts into full-length novels. <br><br>
From idea to manuscript. Without human intervention.

</div>
<br>
NovelGenerator enables writers, storytellers, and LLM enthusiasts to produce complete fiction. The entire generation process runs autonomously while maintaining narrative coherence. An end-to-end novel creation system employs entity relationship modeling for character development while generating structured content at scene-level granularity within a persistent state management framework for world consistency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Package Manager:** npm

## üìã Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
*   npm (comes with Node.js)
*   A Google Gemini API Key

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KazKozDev/NovelGenerator.git 
    cd NovelGenerator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your Gemini API key:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Available Scripts

*   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
*   `npm run preview`: Locally previews the production build.

## üí° How it Works

1.  Enter your story idea in teaser format (see example in the app) and the desired number of chapters.
2.  Our AI will generate a detailed story outline and chapter-by-chapter plan.
3.  Then, it will write each chapter, performing consistency checks along the way.
4.  Finally, your complete book draft will be presented!
5.  Before publication, we recommend a final manual edit to eliminate possible inconsistencies and remove possible technical markup. Re-generation with the same input may give a better result. Save both versions for comparison.
